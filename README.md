### Downloading datasets

Small data set (â‰ˆ4.6gb):

`wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/fxvt2l6bacrya7j/serialized_dataset.zip && unzip serialized_dataset.zip`

### Running with Docker

_Note about GPU usage:_

The quickest way to get Tensorflow running on GPU is with a docker container as
suggested [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker). The following are links to the required software and
instructions on how to install them.

Requirements for GPU:

- [Nvidia Container Tools](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
- [Nvidia Drivers](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-nvidia-drivers-ubuntu)
- [Cuda Tool Kit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)

Build docker images:

`chmod +x build_docker_images.sh && ./build_docker_images.sh`

Before spinning up the containers, have a look at the docker-compose.yml file. If your machine doesn't have an Nvidia
GPU, you will need to comment out the devices being passed into the container. Also set the memory for the container
appropriately.

To start up the Jupyter server run:

`docker-compose up -d && sudo docker-compose logs -f`

Then follow the link with token, example link:

`http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=68fea5fe14cb2a97bb0fb016f0690b91b664e8df9f75436d`

To stop the Jupyter server run:

`docker-compose kill`

_Note: Tensorflow's Docker image uses Python3.8_
